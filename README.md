# docsapi

docsapi is a fork of [sosumi.ai](https://github.com/nshipster/sosumi.ai). It keeps the original Apple Docs rendering pipeline and adds a generic documentation API plus MCP tools for common docset generators.

The hosted instance for this fork is `https://docsapi.xo.vg`.

## Usage

### Apple Docs HTTP API

Replace `developer.apple.com` with `docsapi.xo.vg` 
in any Apple Developer documentation URL:

**Original:**
```
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/array
```

**AI-readable:**
```
https://docsapi.xo.vg/documentation/swift/array
```

This works for all API reference docs, 
as well as Apple's [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/) (HIG).

### Generic Docs API

You can also fetch Markdown for any doc site by appending the raw URL to `/api/`:

```
https://docsapi.xo.vg/api/https://docs.rs/serde/latest/serde/
```

Set `Accept: application/json` to receive a JSON response with `{ url, content }`.
Inputs ending in `.html` are normalized to the extension-less path.

### MCP Integration (docsapi)

docsapi's MCP server supports Streamable HTTP and Server-Sent Events (SSE) transport. 
If your client supports either of these, 
configure it to connect directly to `https://docsapi.xo.vg/mcp`.

Otherwise,
you can run this command to proxy over stdio:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sosumi": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://docsapi.xo.vg/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

See `https://docsapi.xo.vg/#clients` for client-specific instructions.

#### Available Resources

- `doc://{url}` - Documentation at a full URL, rendered as Markdown
  - Example: `doc://https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/array`
  - Example: `doc://https://docs.rs/serde/latest/serde/`

#### Available Tools

- `searchAppleDocumentation` - Searches Apple Developer documentation
  - Parameters: `query` (string)
  - Returns structured results with titles, URLs, descriptions, breadcrumbs, and tags

- `fetchAppleDocumentation` - Fetches Apple Developer documentation and Human Interface Guidelines by path

  - Returns content as Markdown

- `fetchDocumentation` - Fetches documentation from any base URL with docset auto-detection
  - Parameters: `baseUrl` (string), `path` (string, optional), `docsetType` (string, optional)
  - Example: `baseUrl: "https://docs.rs"`, `path: "/serde/latest/serde/"`
  - Example: `baseUrl: "https://docs.python.org/3"`, `path: "/library/asyncio.html"`
  - Returns content as Markdown, plus structured metadata (`docsetType`)

- `searchDocumentation` - Basic search for common docset generators
  - Parameters: `baseUrl` (string), `query` (string), `docsetType` (string, optional)
  - Returns structured results with titles and URLs

### Chrome Extension

You can also use Sosumi from a community-contributed 
[Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/donffakeimppgoehccpfhlchmbfdmfpj?utm_source=item-share-cb),
which adds a "Copy sosumi Link" button 
to Apple Developer documentation pages.
[Source code](https://github.com/FromAtom/Link-Generator-for-sosumi.ai) is available on GitHub.

## Self-Hosting

This project is designed to be easily run on your own machine
or deployed to a hosting provider.

Sosumi.ai is currently hosted by 
[Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com).

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/example-git/docsapi.xo.vg.git
   cd docsapi.xo.vg
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Once the application is up and running, press the <kbd>b</kbd>
to open the URL in your browser.

To configure MCP clients to use your development server, 
replace `docsapi.xo.vg` with the local server address
(`http://localhost:8787` by default).

> [!NOTE]  
> The application is built with Hono, 
> making it compatible with various runtimes.
>
> See the [Hono docs](https://hono.dev/docs/getting-started/basic)
> for more information about deploying to different platforms.

## Development

### Testing

This project uses [vitest](https://vitest.dev)
for  unit and integration testing.

```bash
npm run test          # Run tests
npm run test:ui       # Run tests with UI
npm run test:run      # Run tests once
```

### Code Quality

This project uses [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) 
for code formatting, linting, and import organization.

- `npm run format` - Format all code files
- `npm run lint` - Lint and fix code issues
- `npm run check` - Format, lint, and organize imports (recommended)
- `npm run check:ci` - Check code without making changes (for CI)
